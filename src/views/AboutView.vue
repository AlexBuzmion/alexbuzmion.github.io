      <h3><u>The Game</u></h3>
        <p>
          "Lay-off" is a 3rd person behind-the-back 4-player trap placement deathmatch. Set to provide approximately 10 mins of engaging gameplay. In this game, players find themselves in a high-stakes world where they are 1 of 4 operatives for a spy agency that is forced to downsize their overhead costs due to inflation. 1 operative can escape if they find the key before the whole building blows up.
